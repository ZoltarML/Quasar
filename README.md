# Quasar
  * Finally another public script release after 2 years! Put a little work into this one so it should be interesting.
  * This menu is a multi-purpose Manyland GUI that is meant to enhance the casual scripting experience of the game.
  * Probably won't see another public release from me for awhile[or ever].
  * Made by *Zoltar*

Open your browsers **Developer Console** and run the following command.

```js

$.getScript('whateverthiscdnisgoingtobe')

```

Congrats! You have now succesfully run Quasar!

### Other Player Submenu

 * Players ***cannot*** be unblocked, to unblock a player the page would have to be refreshed.
 
### Terminal Submenu
 * Spaces in targted player names do ***not*** need to be entered into the terminal.
 * When referencing a script with spaces, use the '**-**' character instead of a space
 ```
 Targted players name: John doe               .
 Terminal syntax: channel johndoe. steal
 
 Script name: God Mode
 Terminal Syntax: toggle god-mode
 ```

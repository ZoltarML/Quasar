# Quasar
  * Finally another public script release after 2 years! Put a little work into this one so it should be interesting.
  * This menu is a multi-purpose Manyland GUI that is meant to enhance the casual scripting experience of the game.
  * Probably won't see another public release from me for awhile[or ever].
  * Made by *Zoltar*

### Deployment

Navigate to [Manyland](http://manyland.com).
Open your browsers **Developer Console** and run the following command.

```js

$.getScript('whateverthiscdnisgoingtobe')

```

Congrats! You have now succesfully run Quasar!
